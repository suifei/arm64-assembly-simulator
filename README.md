## Overview

This repository contains a lightweight ARM64 assembly code and memory simulator designed to parse and execute ARM64 assembly instructions from `.s` files, typically generated by IDA Pro's disassembly. It's an ideal tool for those looking to understand the behavior of ARM64 instructions, particularly useful for educational purposes, security analysis, and performance tuning.

## Features

- **Lightweight and Standalone**: Easy to deploy and run without heavy dependencies.
- **Direct Parsing from IDA Outputs**: Seamlessly integrates with disassembly files generated by IDA Pro.
- **Detailed Execution Trace**: Tracks and displays changes in register and memory states after each instruction execution.
- **Support for Step-by-step and Continuous Execution**: Offers flexibility in instruction execution to cater to different analysis needs.
- **Simulates Register and Memory Operations**: Enhances understanding of ARM64 operations through practical simulation.
- **Extensibility**: Supports custom pre- and post-execution hooks, allowing the insertion of custom logic before and after instruction execution.

## Use Cases

- **Educational Tool**: Helps in learning and teaching the structure and applications of the ARM64 instruction set.
- **Prototyping and Testing**: Allows for quick simulation of instruction effects before actual implementation.
- **Security Analysis**: Useful in analyzing how code manipulations affect program states, potentially uncovering security vulnerabilities.
- **Performance Analysis**: Assists in understanding and optimizing code that is critical for performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. This simulator does not require any additional libraries for basic operations.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suifei/arm64-assembly-simulator.git
cd arm64-assembly-simulator
```

### Usage

1. Place your `.s` files containing ARM64 assembly code in the `src/samples` directory.
2. Run the simulator with the following command:
![IDA](screenshots/6.png)
![diasm.s](screenshots/4.png)
![memory.s](screenshots/5.png)

```bash
cd arm64_simulator
python arm64_simulator.py
```

### Configuration

You can modify the `ARM64Simulator` class instantiation in `arm64_simulator.py` to enable step-by-step execution or verbose output, depending on your analysis needs.

1. Basic Setup and Execution:
```python
# Load assembly code and memory settings
asm_data = read_file("samples/diasm.s")
asm_code = load_asm_code(asm_data)
memory_lines = read_file("samples/memory.s")
memory_data = parse_memory_lines(memory_lines)

# Initialize the simulator
vm = ARM64Simulator(memory_data, step_pause=False, verbose=True, output_file="samples/output.s")

# Run the simulator starting from a specified PC address
vm.run(asm_code, pc=0x100AE0D64)
```
2. Using Hooks to Modify Instruction Behavior:
```python
# Define a post-execution hook to convert all CSET instructions to NOP
def nop_ops_after_hook(vm, op_name, operands):
    if op_name == "CSET":
        print(f"AFTER-HOOK# {op_name} to NOP")
        op_name = "NOP"
        operands = []
    return op_name, operands

# Set the simulator's output file
vm.set_output_file("samples/output_with_hooks.s")

# Add the hook and rerun the simulator
vm.hook_instruction(after=nop_ops_after_hook)
vm.run(asm_code, pc=0x100AE0D64)
```
